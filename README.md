# HennepinTheatreTrustDesign
A design of an app for the Hennepin Theater Trust designed specifically for high school students use and involvement. 

**Duration: 6 weeks**

**Role: User Researcher/User Experience Designer**


**Research**

User research was conducted to determine what the most important aspects the initial design would need from a high school student's perspective. 

Because Hennepin Theatre Trust already had a website for their organization, information from there was pulled, gathered, and analyzed to determine what was most suitable and useful for high school students. 

The user research consisted of card sorting major, minor, and nice to have information from their website, which was organized and sorted to fit the needs of high school students.

The card sorting is as follows:

**Major**
* spotlight
* showcase
* contact us/get involved
* student rush tickets
* social media
* upcoming events


**Minor**
* tours
* resources
* about us
* WeDo MPLS
* volunteer

**Nice to have**
* map
* spokespersons 

The development of personas were fictional representations of the community researched who represented the realistic major user group.

The personas for this design project are different, yet the overall goal stays the same. Both personas desire more involvement within the community theatre program. 

Persona Empathy Mapping

Empathy maps were created for each of the personas to highlight their needs, understand what drives their behaviors, and help guide a product that will benefit the users. 

Persona 1

Persona 2

The ideal user would be able to find the information necessary while tailored towards someone with the interests, activities, and culture of a high school student. 

**Objectives**

While refining the feedback of the prototypes, the key design objectives were determined:

* Desire to be entertaining and engaging for high school students 
* Encouraging for users to get involved within the community
* Simple
* Fit culture of current teens (favorites, inclusion of social media, new feed, easily connect with each other)

**Low-Fidelity Prototyping**

Rapid prototyping included a set of basic prototypes with different design approaches to be tested at the low fidelity level for immediate user feedback.

By rapid prototyping the app layout, the concept was able to be showed that it was a valid way for students to be able to get more involved within theatre around the city of Minneapolis. 

The prototypes were tested on a small group of area high school students engaged in a theatre class as well as anyone within the high school community who was looking to get more involved in theatre.  

**Mid-Fidelity**

The goal of the first phase was to receive qualitative data which was used to better understand the thoughts and feelings of the user and gain real insight to what users are experiencing as they are browsing the app.  

The second phase was implemented to understand the quantitative data of the user. This included a desirability test where users were prompted to choose three to five words from a list that best describes their experiences after viewing and handling the app mockups. By doing a desirability test, users post reactions were categorized into which word they felt best described their experience and the words were quantitatively categorized where we can see which words held the majority. 

Phase 1 consisted of a think out loud test where users were prompted to speak freely and describe their thoughts, feelings, and actions while browsing the app mockups. 

Qualitative results:

* "I see the social media stuff right away, which is good since this is for high school students"

* "The spotlight information is prominent but I'm not exactly sure what it is. I'm assuming it is connected to volunteering somehow."

* I wish it was more specific to just students -- in particular high school students"

The qualitative results gives detailed problematic areas which users faced while viewing the app mockups. 

Phase 2 consisted of the desirability test. The words within this test are highlighted below. The red words contain a negative reaction, the blue a positive, and grey is neutral.

The quantitative outcomes of the desirability test show users post reactions included simplicity, informative, and welcoming. But the usability of the app is greatly lacking. 

Outcomes (8 different test subjects)

These designs were implemented into the phase 1 and 2 mid fidelity testing sessions.
